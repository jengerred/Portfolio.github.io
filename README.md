# Portfolio.github.io

## Description:
This is the homepage to my portfolio. It has links to my projects page and my contact me page. This page also includes an about me section. 
## How to Run:  
Just view the page to get to know me as a web developer and click on the navigation bar at the top or the links/buttons within the page. 
## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I plan on adding a youtube video....maybe... I am a very introverted and private person so adding a video makes me anxious.
